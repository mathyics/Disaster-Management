            <h1>Landslides</h1>
            <p>A landslide is a natural disaster where a mass of earth, rock, or debris rapidly moves down a slope due to gravity. This can be triggered by factors like heavy rainfall, earthquakes, volcanic activity, or human activities such as deforestation and construction. Landslides can cause significant damage to infrastructure, disrupt transportation, and pose a serious threat to life and property.</p>
            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <P>Landslides are caused by several factors such as Heavy Rainfall, Earthquake, Volcanic Activity, Erosion Gradual, Deforestation, Human Activities like Construction and mining.</P>
            <h2>Where is the safest place to go during a Landslide</h2>
            <P>During a landslide, the safest place is an area away from the landslide zone, preferably on stable ground and well uphill. If indoors, move to an interior room on the upper floors of a sturdy building. If outdoors, seek higher ground and avoid staying near slopes, cliffs, or unstable terrain.</P>
            <h2>Devices to warn about landslides</h2>
            <p>there are devices like *landslide early warning systems* that use sensors to monitor ground movement, rainfall, and other factors to detect potential landslides. These systems help track and predict landslides in real-time.</p>
