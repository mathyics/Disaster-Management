        <h1>Earth Quake</h1>
   <p>An earthquake is the sudden release of strain energy in the Earth's crust, resulting in waves of shaking that radiate outwards from the earthquake source. When stresses in the crust exceed the strength of the rock, it breaks along lines of weakness, either a pre-existing or new fault plane.</p> 
   <h2>Causes</h2>
   <p>Earthquakes are the result of sudden movement along faults within the Earth. The movement releases stored-up 'elastic strain' energy in the form of seismic waves, which propagate through the Earth and cause the ground surface to shake.</p>
   <h2>How to prevent an earthquake?</h2>
   <p>We cannot prevent natural earthquakes from occurring but we can significantly mitigate their effects by identifying hazards, building safer structures, and providing education on earthquake safety. By preparing for natural earthquakes we can also reduce the risk from human induced earthquakes.</p>
   <h2>Where is the safest place to go during an earthquake?</h2>
   <p>The safest place is an interior room of your house without any windows, such as a bathroom. If possible, take cover under something sturdy, like a heavy table, desk or doorway.8 Feb 2023</p>
   <h2>Richter scale</h2>
   <p>The first widely-used method, the Richter scale, was developed by Charles F. Richter in 1934. It used a formula based on the amplitude of the largest wave recorded on a specific type of seismometer </p>
