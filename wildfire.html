            <h1>Wildfire</h1>
            <p>A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire that rapidly spreads across vegetation, forests, or grasslands, often fueled by dry conditions, high temperatures, and strong winds. Wildfires can ignite naturally from lightning strikes or human activities like unattended campfires, discarded cigarettes, or power lines. Once started, they can quickly engulf large areas, destroying ecosystems, wildlife habitats, homes, and infrastructure.</p>
            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>Wildfires are caused by natural factors like lightning and volcanic eruptions, or human activities such as unattended campfires, discarded cigarettes, arson, and power line failures. Dry conditions, high temperatures, and strong winds exacerbate their spread, making them difficult to control once ignited. </p>
            <h2>How to prevent wildfire?</h2>
            <p>Prevent wildfires by adhering to fire bans, properly extinguishing campfires, avoiding burning debris, and safely disposing of cigarettes. Maintain defensible space around properties by clearing flammable vegetation and using fire-resistant materials. Additionally, follow local regulations and stay informed about fire conditions to reduce risk.</p>
            <h2>Where is the safest place to go during Wildfire?</h2>
            <p> During a wildfire, the safest place is a designated evacuation shelter or a building constructed with fire-resistant materials, away from vegetation and with defensible space. If caught outside, seek shelter in a large, enclosed area such as a building or vehicle, avoiding areas with heavy smoke and flames</p>
